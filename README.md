Josephus Problem Solved using Circular Linked List

Josephus Problem is a counting out game. 
There is a given number of people standing in a circle. 
A specified number is given, lets say x, and every xth person around the circle that person is pushed out. 
The last person standing wins. 

I solved this problem iteratively using circular linked list and dynamic memory. To improve this algorithm I could use smart pointers.
I could have also solved this problem recursively but I wanted to practice using linked list.
